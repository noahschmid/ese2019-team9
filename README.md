# ESE-Project 2019
This was our project for the course 'ESE: Introduction to Software Engineering (Einf√ºhrung in SE)' at the university of Bern. The task was to build a web application that facilitates organizing events. We ended up implementing a [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)-like service where people can offer services (like cathering, audio engineering, photography..) and locations to users. The application was built using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)
